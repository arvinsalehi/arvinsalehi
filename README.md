## About Me
Interested in logical concepts within Intellectual and financial limits.
  
# Path and Resources 
I started with back-end then server administration then machine vision and platfrom engineering. And here you can find some free resources I picked up along the way (Apart of source codes and official documents). I'm interested in learning about linux kernel's, firmware development and maybe compilers???
