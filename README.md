## About Me
Interested in logical concepts within Intellectual and financial limits.
  
# Path and Resources 
I started with back-end then server administration then machine vision on embedded devices and platfrom engineering. And here you can find some of my introductory resources which helped me find my current passion (Apart of source codes and official documents and random source codes based on interests). I'm more aligned towards the desinging, releasing and optimizing software. Maybe a tiny bit Assembly.

## Linux Kernel Development Fundementals
- **Languages**: Rust, C
- **Videos**:
  - [Write Your Own Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/@writeyourownoperatingsystem) (Interesting Tutorial)

- **Practice**:
    - [this repo](https://github.com/jadijadi/riverraidrust) really good hands-on rust pracite 
    - [this repo](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) (Actual World)

## Linux Admin
- **Detail**: Only LPIC1 is recorded in farsi and english. LPIC2 is only recorded in farsi.
- **Videos**:
  - [LPIC1 w/ Jadi (LPIC1 Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKkNUvEHXhk&list=PLFOYXCPEqdNUU55Xvgst8wGTWnz_sd-cj) (Tutorial)

## Embedded Systems
- **Languages**: C, Assembly (ARM)
- **Videos**:
  - ([Education4u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO4AEkOVF2M&list=PLrjkTql3jnm-lZMoUb1xMCp0HgxvJ7ocx)) (General Idea)
  - ([DigiKey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHJ3lxOoWeI)) (level 1 freeRtos practice)

- **Resources**
   - [This website](https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-assembly-part-1/) found on [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/lkdwv7/beginner_resources_for_assembly_arm_programming/). (Through introduction to AssemblyARM)
